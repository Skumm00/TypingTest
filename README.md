Libraries used: time, random, datetime, os

Here is a typing speed checker in python which can be used by just downloading this repo/opening it in your preferred text editor(Like VS Code). The libraries used are time, random, datetime and os(not really used) to get the random sentence. In this program you can use different sentences to type as fast as you can to check your speed/accuracy and more info. You could also use github releases and open it that way
